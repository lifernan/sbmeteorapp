How is a lesson vetted?

words
  Check against lesson in Whitehurst book: all words in lesson should be present
  Play file to make sure filename matches (“book_f.wav” should be a female voice saying “book”)
  Make sure file is the right length (Should stop playing after the word is said, 
    e.g. found a 46 second long file containing many words in cot_f.wav)
  Check compound words against CMU Pronouncing Dictionary - If the compound word is not in the 
    dictionary, break into its component words (e.g. iceube_m.wav becomes ice_cube_m.wav)
  Rename homonyms to match lessons
sentences
  Check against lesson in Whitehurst book: all sentences in lesson should be present
  Make sure corresponding male and female versions match - If the differ, check the book to see 
    which one is wrong.
  Make sure compound words are grouped or separated into their component words in the same way 
    as used in the word file names. (e.g. If pound_cake_f.wav is used, then 
    The_poundcake_is_good_f.wav should be The_pound_cake_is_good_f.wav)


What hasn’t vetting checked?

Whether extra words or sentences are included in our files for a lesson that are not given in the Whitehurst book. Sometimes these are noticed, but the current vetting process does 
not explicitly check for these.

  Update: From lesson 27 onward, vetting checks for this for sentences (following 
    numbering of original filenames).
